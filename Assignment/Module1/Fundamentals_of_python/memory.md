# How memory is managed in Python?

- Python employs a robust memory management system
- It automatically allocates memory for objects as needed and deallocates it when they're no longer referenced.
- This is primarily achieved through reference counting and garbage collection.
- Reference counting keeps track of object references, while garbage collection periodically scans the memory for unreachable objects and reclaims their memory
