# What are negative indexes and why are they used?

- Negative indexes provide a convenient way to access elements from the end of a sequence

- Instead of counting from the beginning, negative indexes count backward from the end
  (-1 for the last element, -2 for the second-to-last, and so on).

**Examples**

```
list = [5,10,15,20,25]

Accessing last element
list1 = list[-1]   # 25

```
